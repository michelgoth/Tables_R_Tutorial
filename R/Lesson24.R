# LESSON 24: EXTERNAL VALIDATION ON AN INDEPENDENT DATASET (TCGA)
# ===============================================================
#
# OBJECTIVE:
# To perform a rigorous external validation of our integrated prognostic
# model using a completely independent dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
#
# WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT:
# A model can perform well on the data it was trained on (even with a
# train-test split) simply because of hidden biases or specific
# characteristics of that single dataset (e.g., patient population,
# sample processing methods). This is called "overfitting" to a cohort.
#
# External validation is the gold standard for proving a model's
# generalizability. If our model, which was trained on CGGA data, can
# successfully stratify patients in the TCGA cohort, it provides strong
# evidence that it has captured a true biological signal and is not just
# a statistical artifact. This is a critical step for clinical translation.
# ===============================================================

# SECTION 0: SETUP ---------------------------------------------
# We will use the TCGAbiolinks package to download and prepare the data.

# SECTION 1: LOAD THE PRE-TRAINED MODEL ARTIFACTS FROM LESSON 21 ----------
# ===============================================================
# We load all the necessary components saved from Lesson 21:
# 1. `final_model`: The final multivariable Cox model.
# 2. `gene_signature`: The character vector of gene names in our signature.
# 3. `cv_fit`: The trained LASSO model object (`cv.glmnet`).
# 4. `top_genes`: The character vector of the 500 genes used to train the LASSO model.

# This process can take several minutes.
