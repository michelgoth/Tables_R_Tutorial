### Lesson 16: Evaluating Treatment Effects with Adjusted Survival Analysis

**Objective:** To learn how to assess the association of a treatment (Radiotherapy) with survival while statistically adjusting for other key prognostic factors. This is a critical skill for analyzing non-randomized, observational data.

#### **Why This Matters**

In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), the treatment and control groups are (on average) balanced in terms of prognostic factors like age, grade, and molecular status. In observational data from a hospital registry, this is almost never the case.

For example, younger, healthier patients might be more likely to receive radiotherapy (RT) than older, sicker patients. If we just compare the survival of patients who got RT to those who didn't (a "univariable" analysis), we might find that the RT group does better. But is it because of the RT itself, or because they were younger and healthier to begin with? This problem is called **confounding**.

A **multivariable-adjusted analysis** is the standard technique to address this. By including key prognostic factors (like age, grade, IDH, MGMT) in our Cox model alongside the treatment variable, we can estimate the effect of the treatment *while holding the other factors constant*. It helps us get closer to a "fair" comparison in the absence of randomization.

#### **What the R Script Does**

The `R/Lesson16.R` script performs a standard adjusted analysis for radiotherapy:

1.  **Descriptive Kaplan-Meier Plot:** It first generates a simple KM plot comparing the survival curves of patients who received radiotherapy (`RT`) versus those who did not (`No RT`). This shows the unadjusted, observational difference.
2.  **Adjusted Cox Model:** It then fits a multivariable Cox model where `Radio_status` is the primary variable of interest, and other key variables (`Age`, `Grade`, `IDH`, `MGMT`) are included as covariates to adjust for their effects.
3.  **Forest Plot of the Adjusted HR:** It creates a forest plot that focuses specifically on the Hazard Ratio for radiotherapy from the adjusted model, showing its effect after accounting for the confounders.

#### **Step-by-Step Analysis in `R/Lesson16.R`**

**1. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier Comparison**
*Clinical Question:* In our raw data, how does the survival of patients who received RT compare to those who didn't?
```r
# Create KM plot for RT vs No RT
fit_km <- survfit(Surv(OS, Censor) ~ Radio_factor, data = df)
plot(fit_km, ...)
```

**2. Adjusted Cox Model for Radiotherapy**
*Clinical Question:* After adjusting for age, grade, and key molecular markers, is radiotherapy still associated with a survival benefit?
```r
# Build a Cox model including Radio_factor and the adjustment variables
cox_formula <- as.formula("Surv(OS, Censor) ~ Radio_factor + Age + Grade + IDH + MGMT")
fit_cox <- coxph(cox_formula, data = df)
summary(fit_cox)
```

#### **Key Clinical Insights & Interpretation**

*   **Comparing the KM plot and the Adjusted HR:** It is very instructive to compare the initial, unadjusted KM plot with the final, adjusted Hazard Ratio for radiotherapy. You may see a large difference in survival in the KM plot, but the HR for `Radio_factor` in the adjusted model might be closer to 1.0. This would suggest that much of the initial observed "benefit" was actually due to the confounding factors (i.e., the patients selected for RT were already a better-prognosis group).
*   **Interpreting the Adjusted HR:** The Hazard Ratio for `Radio_factor` from the multivariable model tells you the association of radiotherapy with survival *after* accounting for the other variables. An HR of 0.60, for example, would be interpreted as: "After adjusting for age, grade, IDH, and MGMT status, radiotherapy was associated with a 40% reduction in the hazard of death."
*   **Correlation vs. Causation:** It is critical to remember that even a well-adjusted analysis from observational data shows an *association*, not *causation*. We cannot conclude that RT *causes* better survival, only that it is independently associated with it in this dataset. RCTs are the gold standard for proving causation.

#### **How to Run the Script**

To perform the adjusted analysis for radiotherapy, run this command:

```bash
Rscript R/Lesson16.R
```

**Next:** In the final lesson, we will synthesize the findings from our models to create a simple, point-based prognostic risk score, a tool commonly used in clinical practice.
