> **A clinical, code-first learning resource using a single provided dataset.**

---

## Target Audience

This curriculum is designed specifically for those who are new to bioinformatics and R programming. The goal is to provide a practical, clinically-relevant introduction to data analysis without assuming a background in coding.

---

## Overview

This repository provides a structured, hands-on curriculum for clinical data analysis in R. It uses the provided clinical dataset exclusively and focuses on reproducible scripts, clear explanations, and automatically generated plots saved to `plots/`.

---

## Key Features

### Curriculum (Lessons 1–18)
- Lessons 1–3: Import, descriptive statistics, categorical visualization
- Lessons 4–6: Kaplan–Meier, log-rank test, multivariable Cox
- Lessons 7–11: Association tests, group comparisons, logistic regression, correlation, ANOVA/MANOVA
- Lessons 12–18: Clinician extensions (baseline/missingness/PH checks), ML basics, IDH×MGMT joint groups, TMZ×MGMT interaction, radiotherapy adjusted analysis, parsimonious risk score, and **model validation**

### Visualization
- Publication-ready plots saved to `plots/` (PDF and PNG)
- Consistent utilities via `R/utils.R`

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- R 4.0 or higher
- RStudio (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kevinj24fr/Tables_R_Tutorial.git
   cd Tables_R_Tutorial
   ```

2. Run the setup script
   ```r
   source("R/setup.R")
   ```

3. Run a lesson (plots are saved under `plots/`)
   ```r
   source("R/Lesson1.R")
   ```
   We recommend reading the corresponding lesson explanation in [`docs/Lesson01.md`](docs/Lesson01.md) as you run the script.

## Learning Path (Clinical and Dataset-Focused)
- Lesson 1: Setup, data import, first clinical plots
- Lesson 2: Descriptive statistics and distributions
- Lesson 3: Clinical feature visualization (categorical)
- Lesson 4: Kaplan–Meier survival by IDH
- Lesson 5: Log-rank test (MGMT or IDH)
- Lesson 6: Multivariable Cox regression
- Lesson 7: Association tests (Chi-square, Fisher)
- Lesson 8: Group comparisons for continuous variables (Wilcoxon/t-test)
- Lesson 9: Logistic regression (binary outcome)
- Lesson 10: Correlation matrix for numeric variables
- Lesson 11: ANOVA/MANOVA (group comparisons, post-hoc, assumptions)
- Lesson 12: Baseline table, missingness, univariable HRs, risk stratification, PH checks
- Lesson 13: Machine learning basics (feature importance)
- Lesson 14: Joint risk groups (IDH × MGMT)
- Lesson 15: Temozolomide benefit and MGMT interaction
- Lesson 16: Radiotherapy adjusted analysis
- Lesson 17: Parsimonious prognostic score (point-based)
- Lesson 18: **Model validation with train-test split**
